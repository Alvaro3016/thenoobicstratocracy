    <h2>History and Overview of the Stratocracy</h2>
    <p>The Noobic Stratocracy is a unitary state where power is held by the military. Located on the resource-rich island of Noobia, it occupies the eastern half, sharing it with its main rival, the Federal Republic of Noobia. The Stratocracy is a moderately powerful, conservative, and secluded country, with a large army and navy and near-fanatical patriotism among its people. The capital is Novis Bellum, and the national bird is the Noobic Robin.</p>
    <h3>Group Information</h3>
    <p>The 3rd Noob Division was founded in 2015 by ClassicMasterNoob. Over the years, the group has grown, shut down, and revived multiple times. In 2025, it was renamed to the Noobic Stratocracy, focusing more on lore, worldbuilding, and community. The Stratocracy has over forty thousand members and unique technology, including planes, tanks, and advanced naval tech.</p>
